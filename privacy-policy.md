### Unleash live – Privacy Policy


Unleash live Pty Limited is committed to dealing with users’ personal information in accordance with the Australian National Privacy Principles as set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000.


**Collection of personal information** 
 
The Company collects personal information about you in order to provide the media sharing, location and social networking services through its Unleash live service. Your personal information is stored and processed on our servers in Australia, Asia and in the United States.

The type of personal information the Company collects includes your name, address, telephone numbers, flight logs, drones and cameras connected, location (ie your then-current and earlier locations), and other information submitted by you through the Unleash live service.  

* Our Service collects geolocation information when you use our mobile application. This information may include your physical location, such as street address, latitude and longitude, and Internet Protocol address, and the time of recording the location or the duration at that location.
* Our Service collects data from our mobile application and umanned aerial vehicless (“UAVs” or “drones”), including telemetry data, map data, location data, and data regarding the systems of the vehicles.
* We collect payment and billing information when sign up for our paid Services, including name and contact information. You might also provide payment information such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.

Personal Information does not include “aggregate” or other non-personally identifiable information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, Service, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed.

This policy also explains your choices about how we use information about you, including how you can object to certain uses of the data, as well as how you can access or update certain information about you. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our Services.


**Use of Personal Information**  

The personal information the Company collects about you may be used for purposes connected with our business operations, including:
* the proper operation of the Unleash live system; 
* send you notifications regarding new services offered by the Company; 
* carrying out market and product analysis and marketing products and services of the Company, its related bodies corporate and third parties; 
* contacting you, whether through the unleash live application or otherwise, about our group companies' products and services; and
* carrying out any activity in connection with a legal, governmental or regulatory requirement on us or in connection with legal proceedings, crime or fraud prevention, detection or prosecution. 


We may also use your information to contact you regarding our Services, and offers, both from ourselves and from third parties, which we believe you may find of interest. You may opt-out from receiving marketing communications from us as described in the “Choice” section below.


The Company also may use your personal information for purposes related to those described above which would be reasonably expected by you. 


The Company may not use customer personal information for any other purposes unless it has obtained the customer’s consent or required for law enforcement or public health and safety reasons.
